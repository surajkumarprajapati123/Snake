# Snack Game

## Description

The Snack Game is a simple web-based game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It simulates the classic Snake game where the player controls a snake that moves around the screen, eating food pellets to grow longer while avoiding collisions with the walls and itself.

## Features

- Snake Movement: The player can control the movement of the snake using arrow keys.
- Food Pellets: Food pellets randomly appear on the screen for the snake to eat, increasing its length.
- Score Tracking: The game keeps track of the player's score based on the number of food pellets eaten.
- Game Over Detection: The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or itself.
- Responsive Design: The game layout adjusts to different screen sizes.
